# Face recognition: 
The system has face recognition which helps to recognize a human face through technology. A face recognition model maps facial features from security camera and compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match. In this situation, the camera at entrance captures everyone at distance close to the door, and if the person in know, the autonomous door opens. However, if the person is new, the notification is sent to the house owner, and he or he can accept the person to enter or decide to use another means of communication such as voice message, direction towards alarm or communicate to the security guard.  
There are two data sets, one is for know people in the house and another is for real time caption of the people coming to the house.
In addition, after the image classifier, out put is sent to firebase, and if the output is that a person is unknown, notification is automatically sent, but if is known, the door is supposed to open without notifying the house master. 
There is also, a page for this functionality of the mobile application.
